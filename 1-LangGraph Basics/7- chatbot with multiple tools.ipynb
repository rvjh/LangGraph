       "'Published: 2023-01-03\\nTitle: Deep Learning and Computational Physics (Lecture Notes)\\nAuthors: Deep Ray, Orazio Pinti, Assad A. Oberai\\nSummary: These notes were compiled as lecture notes for a course developed and taught at the University of the Southern California. They should be accessible to a typical engineering graduate student with a strong background in Applied Mathematics.\\n  The main objective of these notes is to introduce a student who is familiar with concepts in linear algebra and partial differential equations to select topics in deep learning. These lecture notes exploit the strong connections between deep learning algorithms and the more conventional techniques of computational physics to achieve two goals. First, they use concepts from computational physics to develop an understanding of deep learning algorithms. Not surprisingly, many concepts in deep learning can be connected to similar concepts in computational physics, and one can utilize this connection to better understand these algorithms. Second, several novel deep learning algorithms can be used to solve challenging problems in computational physics. Thus, they offer someone who is interested in modeling a physical phenomena with a complementary set of tools.\\n\\nPublished: 2021-07-22\\nTitle: Memorization in Deep Neural Networks: Does the Loss Function matter?\\nAuthors: Deep Patel, P. S. Sastry\\nSummary: Deep Neural Networks, often owing to the overparameterization, are shown to be capable of exactly memorizing even randomly labelled data. Empirical studies have also shown that none of the standard regularization techniques mitigate such overfitting. We investigate whether the choice of the loss function can affect this memorization. We empirically show, with benchmark data sets MNIST and CIFAR-10, that a symmetric loss function, as opposed to either cross-entropy or squared error loss, results in significant improvement in the ability of the network to resist such overfitting. We then provide a formal definition for robustness to memorization and provide a theoretical explanation as to why the symmetric losses provide this robustness. Our results clearly bring out the role loss functions alone can play in this phenomenon of memorization.'"

       "'Page: WhatsApp\\nSummary: WhatsApp Messenger, commonly known simply as WhatsApp, is an American social media, instant messaging (IM), and Voice over IP (VoIP) service accessible via desktop and mobile app. Owned by Meta Platforms, the service allows users to send text messages, voice messages, and video messages, make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other content. The service requires a cellular mobile telephone number to register. WhatsApp was launched in May 2009. In January 2018, WhatsApp released a standalone business app called WhatsApp Business which can communicate with the standard WhatsApp client. As of May 2025, the service had 3 billion monthly active users, making it the most used messenger app. The name of the app is meant to sound like \"what\\'s up\".\\nThe service was created by WhatsApp Inc. of Mountain View, California, which was acquired by Facebook in February 2014 for approximately US$19.3 billion. It became the world\\'s most popular messaging application in 2015, with 900 million users, and had more than 2 billion active users worldwide in February 2020. WhatsApp Business had approximately 200 million monthly users in 2023. By 2016, it had become the primary means of Internet communication in regions including the Americas, the Indian subcontinent, and large parts of Europe and Africa.'"

[...] Agentic systems turned LLMs and coding assistants into something more dynamic in 2025. And this is just the beginning, according to Ismael Faro, VP of Quantum and AI at IBM Research. He sees software moving from informal interactions to a structured approach where users set goals and validate progress while autonomous agents execute tasks and request human approval.\\n\\n“Software practice will evolve from vibe coding to Objective-Validation Protocol,” said Faro in an interview with IBM Think. “The users are going to define goals and validate while collections of agents autonomously execute, extending the idea of human-in-the-loop, requesting human approval at critical checkpoints.”',\n",

      "Authors: Deep Pandey, Qi Yu\n",
      "Summary: Evidential deep learning, built upon belief theory and subjective logic, offers a principled and computationally efficient way to turn a deterministic neural network uncertainty-aware. The resultant evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using the learned evidence. To ensure theoretically sound evidential models, the evidence needs to be non-negative, which requires special activation functions for model training and inference. This constraint often leads to inferior predictive performance compared to standard softmax models, making it challenging to extend them to many large-scale datasets. To unveil the real cause of this undesired behavior, we theoretically investigate evidential models and identify a fundamental limitation that explains the inferior performance: existing evidential activation functions create zero evidence regions, which prevent the model to learn from training samples falling into such regions. A deeper analysis of evidential activation functions based on our theoretical underpinning inspires the design of a novel regularizer that effectively alleviates this fundamental limitation. Extensive experiments over many challenging real-world datasets and settings confirm our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.\n",

      "Authors: Julius Berner, Philipp Grohs, Gitta Kutyniok, Philipp Petersen\n",
      "Summary: We describe the new field of mathematical analysis of deep learning. This field emerged around a list of research questions that were not answered within the classical framework of learning theory. These questions concern: the outstanding generalization power of overparametrized neural networks, the role of depth in deep architectures, the apparent absence of the curse of dimensionality, the surprisingly successful optimization performance despite the non-convexity of the problem, understanding what features are learned, why deep architectures perform exceptionally well in physical problems, and which fine aspects of an architecture affect the behavior of a learning task in which way. We present an overview of modern approaches that yield partial answers to these questions. For selected approaches, we describe the main ideas in more detail.\n",

Since then, the open-source AI ecosystem has grown a lot, with smaller, domain-specific models achieving impressive results—it’s the case for IBM’s Granite, Ai2’s Olmo 3 and, of course, DeepSeek’s models. Anthony Annunziata, Director of Open Source AI at IBM and the AI Alliance, sees this trend accelerating in 2026.\\n\\n“We’re going to see smaller reasoning models that are multimodal and easier to tune for specific domains,” he said during an interview with IBM Think. [...] After much skepticism around AI’s ROI, AI capabilities will pave new ways to do business in the enterprise. And open-source reasoning models and agents will keep pushing boundaries to conquer enterprise AI.\\n\\nAt the same time, trust and security will become key priorities as many enterprises sharpen their focus on AI sovereignty.\\n\\nThat’s just the opening act for what’s to come in enterprise tech in the days ahead.

      "Summary: Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.\n",
      "ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics.\n",
      "Statistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods compose the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) through unsupervised learning.\n",
      "From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning. Most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as empirical risk minimisation under this framework.\n",
